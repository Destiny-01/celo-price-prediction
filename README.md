A fun bitcoin price prediction app with a mobile-first decentralized design in mind built with React Native and solidity for the contract

## Getting Started

This is a react native app, and the contracts were made with solidity. You'll need to clone and run the react app locally (detailed instructions are in the apps/mobile README, aswell as the README for the contracts. Once you follow them, you can get your app running, and begin testing 

In order to clone, a simple `git clone` will do it

You can run `pnpm install`, then go into the apps/ folder, and look at the specific READMEs for the mobile or contract as they each contain instructions on how to run them
